# Tensorflow:
* Open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. 
* Originally developed by Google Brain Team to conduct machine learning and deep neural networks research
* TensorFlow provides an extensive suite of functions and classes that allow users to build various models from scratch.
# Why TensorFlow?
* Python API
* Portability: CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API
* Flexibility: from Raspberry Pi, Android, Windows, iOS, Linux to server farms
* Visualization: TensorBoard
* Checkpoints: for managing experiments
* Auto-differentiation autodiff (no more taking derivatives by hand)
* Large community
